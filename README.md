# WishList
A team project from the Integrative Software Engineering course.
The project is managed in the ***SCRUM methodology***, divided into several sprints with each sprint lasting two weeks.

The team contains **7 students**, each with his own specialization, but we all contribute to everything and manage the development together through the **Trello** system.

The project is called WishList, a system for managing a list of products that the user would like to buy.
The main emphasis in this project is in the world of ***IOB - Internet Of Behavior***. Therefore, we would like to collect as much information as possible about the users of the app during use.

**Backend: Spring, Hibernate, Apache Tomcat, H2 Database, Jackson**

The instructions for each sprint and our submission are attached.
