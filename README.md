# WishList
A team project from the Integrative Software Engineering course.
The project is conducted in the *SCRUM methodology*, divided into several sprints with each sprint lasting two weeks.

The team contains #7 students#, each with his own specialization, but we all contribute to everything and manage the development together through the #Trello# system.

The project is called WishList, a system for managing a list of products I would like to buy.
The main emphasis in this project is in the world of #IOB - Internet Of Behavior#. Therefore, we would like to collect as much information as possible about the users of the app during use.

The instructions for each sprint and our submission are attached.
